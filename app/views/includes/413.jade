h4 Any player
p
    | In order to move onto the pitch, the player must be on the Subs' 
    | Bench (not the Sin Bin) and have an action played on them that allows them 
    | to move at least 1 hex. The first hex must be the entry hex adjacent to 
    | the Subs' Bench. The rest of the action is resolved as normal. Note that a 
    | player can only 
    a(href="/actions/#{Enums.Actions.SLAM}") #{Constants[Enums.Actions.SLAM]}
    | , etc... when they are actually standing on the board &mdash; this is not 
    | possible while they are still standing on the Subs' Bench.

h5 Moving off the pitch
p
    | This is like entering the pitch in reverse. The player must move off through 
    | the entry hex, and must have enough movement to continue into the Subs' 
    | Bench as if it was a separate hex. A player may only move onto their own 
    | team's Subs' Bench.
