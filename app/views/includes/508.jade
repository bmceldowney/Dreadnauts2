h4 Any player
p
	| Once per rush the player may re-roll any one dice that they have rolled 
	| for a normal test. Declare that you will do this after you and any opponent 
	| have both rolled your dice normally, but before you apply any results.
p
	| If both players have #{Constants[Enums.Abilities.LUCKY]} or #{Constants[Enums.Abilities.REALLY_LUCKY]} 
	| then the active player chooses first whether to re-roll or not.
p
	| Re-rolling the dice means just that. Whatever result was rolled initially 
	| is ignored; only the result of the re-roll counts. If the re-rolled dice
	| is a 6 then it counts as a success and generates an extra roll as normal.
