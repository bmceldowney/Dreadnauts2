    | At the end of any action, if a player is in the entry hex of the opposing 
    | team's Subs' Bench then it is a #{Constants[Enums.Actions.STALL]}. This is 
    | true even if the player has fallen over.
p
    | A #{Constants[Enums.Actions.STALL]} is a Foul, and the opposing player 
    | may make a 
    a(href="/actions/#{Enums.Actions.REFCHECK}") #{Constants[Enums.Actions.REFCHECK]}.
