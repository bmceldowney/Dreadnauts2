    #### Any #{Constants[Enums.Races.ROBOT]} player

    A player with this ability will always start the game as a #{Constants[Enums.Positions.JACK]}, and gains the [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.TRANSFORM]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.TRANSFORM}) action. During the game they can spend an action to #{Constants[Enums.Actions.TRANSFORM]} into a #{Constants[Enums.Positions.GUARD]} or #{Constants[Enums.Positions.STRIKER]}. Once they have changed into another role, the player remains in that role until they perform another successful #{Constants[Enums.Actions.TRANSFORM]} action or the game ends.

    During the game, a player with the #{Constants[Enums.Abilities.QUICKCHANGEARTIST]} ability is counted as being the role they are currently in for the purposes of all game rules. The player may only use the actions and abilities that are appropriate to their current role.

    In a league, the player earns and records experience just like any other player, based on whichever role they are in at that moment. When making advancement rolls, the player make choose any advancement table. However, abilities that are exclusive to a specific role, only apply to the player when the they are in that role.
