    #### Any player

    Once per rush the player may re-roll any one dice that they have rolled for a normal test. Declare that you will do this after you and any opponent have both rolled your dice normally, but before you apply any results.

    If both players have #{Constants[Enums.Abilities.LUCKY]} or #{Constants[Enums.Abilities.REALLYLUCKY]} then the active player chooses first whether to re-roll or not.

    Re-rolling the dice means just that. Whatever result was rolled initially is ignored; only the result of the re-roll counts. If the re-rolled dice is a 6 then it counts as a success and generates an extra roll as normal.
