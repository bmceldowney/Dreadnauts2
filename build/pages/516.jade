    Any player

    Once per match a player with this ability may call a Foul! against an opposing player of their choice. This is a ruse. The opposing player has done nothing wrong, but #{Constants[Enums.Abilities.DIRTYTRICKS]} has made it seem otherwise.

    The opposing player takes a [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.REFCHECK]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.REFCHECK}) exactly as if they were guilty of a Foul! and may be sent off the pitch as normal.

    Note that both players must be on the field when this ability is used.
