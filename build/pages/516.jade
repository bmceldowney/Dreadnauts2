h4 Any player
p
    | Once per match a player with this ability may call a Foul! against an 
    | opposing player of their choice. This is a ruse. The opposing player has 
    | done nothing wrong, but #{Constants[Enums.Abilities.DIRTYTRICKS]} has made
    | it seem otherwise.
p
    | The opposing player takes a Ref Check exactly as if they were guilty of a
    | Foul! and may be sent off the pitch as normal.
p
    | Note that both players must be on the field when this ability is used.
