    | At the end of any action, if a team has more than 6 players on the pitch 
    | then it is a #{Constants[Enums.Actions.SNEAK]}.
p
    | A #{Constants[Enums.Actions.SNEAK]} is a Foul, and the opposing player 
    | may make a 
    a(href="/actions/#{Enums.Actions.REFCHECK}") #{Constants[Enums.Actions.REFCHECK]}
    | . If the #{Constants[Enums.Actions.REFCHECK]} is successful then a player 
    | from the offending team is sent off the pitch at random.
