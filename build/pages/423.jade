    #### Any player

    At the end of any action, if a team has more than 6 players on the pitch then it is a #{Constants[Enums.Actions.SNEAK]}.

    A #{Constants[Enums.Actions.SNEAK]} is a Foul, and the opposing player may make a [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.REFCHECK]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.REFCHECK}). If the #{Constants[Enums.Actions.REFCHECK]} is successful then a player from the offending team is sent off the pitch at random.
