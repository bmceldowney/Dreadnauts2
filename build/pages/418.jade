    #### #{Constants[Enums.Positions.KEEPER]} only

    Only a player with the [#{Constants[Enums.Abilities.KEEPER]}](/abilities/#{Enums.Abilities.KEEPER}) ability may perform a #{Constants[Enums.Actions.PUNT]} action.

    \#{Constants[Enums.Actions.PUNT]} is a hugely inaccurate means of getting rid of the ball. The ball may be placed anywhere on the pitch. Scatter the ball immediately from the hex it was placed in, then scatter it again when it comes to a rest.

    Note that a #{Constants[Enums.Actions.PUNT]} can never be used to make a Strike.

    Also note that a #{Constants[Enums.Actions.PUNT]} does count as losing the ball and therefore ends the player's rush.
