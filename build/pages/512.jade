    a(href="/abilities/#{Enums.Actions.SLAM}") #{Constants[Enums.Actions.SLAM]} 
    | an opposing player at any time during an opponent's rush. When this happens
    | the opposing player must stop what they are doing and wait for the #{Constants[Enums.Actions.SLAM]}
    | attempt to resolve before continuing with their declared action.

    | This ability may only be played once per game, and only if the player 
    | with #{Constants[Enums.Abilities.RUNNINGINTERFERENCE]} is not in posession 
    | of the ball. The player may use this ability again if the appropriate Special 
    | Move card is played on them.
