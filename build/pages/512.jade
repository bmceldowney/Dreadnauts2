    #### #{Constants[Enums.Positions.JACK]} only

    A player with #{Constants[Enums.Abilities.RUNNINGINTERFERENCE]} may attempt to [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.SLAM]}](/abilities/#{Enums.Actions.SLAM}) an opposing player at any time during an opponent's rush. When this happens the opposing player must stop what they are doing and wait for the #{Constants[Enums.Actions.SLAM]} attempt to resolve before continuing with their declared action.

    This ability may only be played once per game, and only if the player with #{Constants[Enums.Abilities.RUNNINGINTERFERENCE]} is not in posession of the ball. The player may use this ability again if the appropriate Special Move card is played on them.

    For more information visit the [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.SLAM]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.SLAM}) page.
