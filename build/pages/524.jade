    #### Any player

    When a player with the #{Constants[Enums.Abilities.QUICKRECOVERY]} ability is injured, they take an [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.ARMORCHECK]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.ARMORCHECK}) as usual, but replace the normal #{Constants[Enums.Actions.ARMORCHECK]} table with the following:

table.table.table-striped
    tr
        td 0 damage
        td The player remains on the pitch as normal.
    tr
        td 1&ndash;3 damage
        td The player is in the Sin Bin for 1 turn.
    tr
        td 4+ damage
        td The player is dead. Remove them from the game.
