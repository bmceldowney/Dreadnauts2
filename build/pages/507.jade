    #### #{Constants[Enums.Positions.GUARD]} only

    A #{Constants[Enums.Abilities.KEEPER]} is a type of Guard, and unless a rule specifically differentiates between the two, or is overridden here, the player should still be treated as a Guard.

    * Armor is increased to 3
    * Player can [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.PICKUP]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.PICKUP})
    * Player can [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.CATCH]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.CATCH})  
    * Player can [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.PUNT]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.PUNT}) 

    Unlike a pure Guard, a #{Constants[Enums.Abilities.KEEPER]} can #{Constants[Enums.Actions.PICKUP]} and #{Constants[Enums.Actions.CATCH]} the ball at -1 dice. A #{Constants[Enums.Abilities.KEEPER]} cannot #{Constants[Enums.Actions.THROW]} the ball, but they do have a unique action called #{Constants[Enums.Actions.PUNT]}. A #{Constants[Enums.Actions.PUNT]} cannot be used to make a Strike, and it does count as losing the ball and ends the rush.
