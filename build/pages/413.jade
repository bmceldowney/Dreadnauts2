    #### Any player

    In order to #{Constants[Enums.Actions.MOVEONTOTHEPITCH]}, the player must be on the Subs' Bench (not the Sin Bin) and have an action played on them that allows them to move at least 1 hex. The first hex must be the entry hex adjacent to the Subs' Bench. The rest of the action is resolved as normal. Note that a player can only [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.SLAM]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.SLAM}), etc… when they are actually standing on the board — this is not possible while they are still standing on the Subs' Bench.

    ##### Moving off the pitch

    This is like entering the pitch in reverse. The player must move off through the entry hex, and must have enough movement to continue into the Subs' Bench as if it was a separate hex. A player may only move onto their own team's Subs' Bench.
