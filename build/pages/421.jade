    #### Any player

    A #{Constants[Enums.Actions.REFCHECK]} is called for when a player commits a Foul.

    ##### Resolving a #{Constants[Enums.Actions.REFCHECK]}

    * Roll 1 die for the "Eye in the Sky".
    * Roll 1 die for the Ref if they are within 7 hexes of the offending player. In the case of a #{Constants[Enums.Actions.SNEAK]} attempt, this may be any player from the offending team that is currently on the pitch. Note that the Ref has no facing and can see in any direction.
    * This number may be modified by Event Cards.

    Roll all of the dice at once. The dice are rolled by the Coach whose team is not under suspicion. Roll each dice separately, then total the dice that rolled 1&ndash;3 and consult the following table:

table.table.table-striped
    tr
        td Total is 0
        td The Ref ignores the Foul, and the player remains in play.
    tr
        td Total is 1, 2 or 3
        td The player is sent to the Sin Bin for that many turns.
    tr
        td Total is 4+
        td The player is sent off the pitch for the rest of the match.

    Note that if more than one Foul needs to be resolved at the same time, then they should be resolved in the following order:

    1. [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.SUCKERPUNCH]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.SUCKERPUNCH})
    2. [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.STOMP]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.STOMP})
    3. [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.STALL]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.STALL})
    4. [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.SNEAK]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.SNEAK})
    5. [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.DISTRACTTHEREF]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.DISTRACTTHEREF})
