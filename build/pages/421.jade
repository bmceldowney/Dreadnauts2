p
    | A #{Constants[Enums.Actions.REFCHECK]} is called for when a player commits 
    | a Foul.

h5 Resolving a #{Constants[Enums.Actions.REFCHECK]}
ul
    li Roll 1 die for the "Eye in the Sky".
    li 
        | Roll 1 die for the Ref if they are within 7 hexes of the offending player. 
        | In the case of a #{Constants[Enums.Actions.SNEAK]} attempt, this may be 
        | any player from the offending team that is currently on the pitch. Note 
        | that the Ref has no facing and can see in any direction.
    li This number may be modified by Event Cards.
p
    | Roll all of the dice at once. The dice are rolled by the Coach whose team 
    | is not under suspicion. Roll each dice separately, then total the dice that 
    | rolled 1&ndash;3 and consult the following table:

table.table.table-striped
    tr
        td Total is 0
        td The Ref ignores the Foul, and the player remains in play.
    tr
        td Total is 1, 2 or 3
        td The player is sent to the Sin Bin for that many turns.
    tr
        td Total is 4+
        td The player is sent off the pitch for the rest of the match.

p
    | Note that if more than one Foul needs to be resolved at the same time, then 
    | they should be resolved in the following order:
ol
    li: a(href="/actions/#{Enums.Actions.SUCKERPUNCH}") #{Constants[Enums.Actions.SUCKERPUNCH]}
    li: a(href="/actions/#{Enums.Actions.STOMP}") #{Constants[Enums.Actions.STOMP]}
    li: a(href="/actions/#{Enums.Actions.STALL}") #{Constants[Enums.Actions.STALL]}
    li: a(href="/actions/#{Enums.Actions.SNEAK}") #{Constants[Enums.Actions.SNEAK]}
    li: a(href="/actions/#{Enums.Actions.DISTRACTTHEREF}") #{Constants[Enums.Actions.DISTRACTTHEREF]}
