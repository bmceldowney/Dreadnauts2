    #### Any player

    A player with the #{Constants[Enums.Abilities.THREESIXTYVISION]} ability has no rear arc. In effect, it does not matter which direction the player faces when attempting to take an action such as [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.CATCH]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.CATCH}), or when they are the target of a [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.SLAM]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.SLAM}) attempt.

    Note that a player with this ability also has 6 Threat Hexes, instead of 3.
