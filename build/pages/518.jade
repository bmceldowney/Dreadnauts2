    #### #{Constants[Enums.Positions.JACK]} only

    \#{Constants[Enums.Abilities.EVENTHEODDS]} is the same as [#{Constants[Enums.Abilities.RUNNINGINTERFERENCE]}](/actions/#{Enums.Abilities.RUNNINGINTERFERENCE}) with two exceptions:

    * #{Constants[Enums.Abilities.EVENTHEODDS]} may only be used when the player's team is losing the match.
    * A player with #{Constants[Enums.Abilities.EVENTHEODDS]} may use the ability once per Rush for as long as their team is losing.

    For more information visit the [#{Constants[Enums.Abilities.RUNNINGINTERFERENCE]}](/abilities/#{Enums.Abilities.RUNNINGINTERFERENCE}) page.
