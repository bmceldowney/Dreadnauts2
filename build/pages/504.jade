    #### Any player

    A player with the #{Constants[Enums.Abilities.GOTCHA]} ability is difficult to get away from. This manifests in two ways: 

    * Whenever a player would take a -1 penalty for being in the Threat Hex of a player with this ability, they take a -2 penalty instead.
    * If an opposing player fails to [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.EVADE]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.EVADE}) from a player with this ability, then they do not move at all and their action ends.
