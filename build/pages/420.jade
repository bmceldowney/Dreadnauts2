    #### #{Constants[Enums.Positions.STRIKER]} or #{Constants[Enums.Positions.JACK]} only

    Only a player with the [#{Constants[Enums.Abilities.MISDIRECT]}](/abilities/#{Enums.Abilities.MISDIRECT}) ability may perform a #{Constants[Enums.Actions.FEINT]} action.

    The player attempts move an opponent without injuring them. A #{Constants[Enums.Positions.STRIKER]} may take a full [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.RUN]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.RUN}) action as part of a #{Constants[Enums.Actions.FEINT]} attempt, and may [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.DASH]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.DASH}) if they choose to do so. A #{Constants[Enums.Positions.JACK]} may move up to 1 hex before making a #{Constants[Enums.Actions.SLAM]}, turning for free if they wish, but may not #{Constants[Enums.Actions.DASH]} unless they have the [#{Constants[Enums.Abilities.SLIDE]}](/abilities/#{Enums.Abilities.SLIDE}) ability.

    ##### #{Constants[Enums.Actions.FEINT]} is a 3 dice Speed test (1)

    * +1 if the player is a #{Constants[Enums.Races.JUDWAN]}.
    * +1 if the player began this action while adjacent to the target.
    * -1 per opposing player threatening the hex the player is in (ignoring the target, maximum of -2).

    The target may attempt to [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.DODGE]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.DODGE}) or [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.SLAMBACK]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.SLAMBACK}) in response to this action.
