    #### #{Constants[Enums.Positions.GUARD]} only

    A player with the #{Constants[Enums.Abilities.PRIMADONNA]} ability wants desperately to be a Striker. At the beginning of the match, roll one die before setting up any players on the pitch. On a roll of 1, deploy the player as a Striker. Otherwise, deploy them as a normal Guard.

    If the player is deployed as a Striker, the following takes place:

    * Armor is decreased to 5.
    * The player can [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.PICKUP]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.PICKUP}).
    * The player can [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.THROW]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.THROW}).
    * The player can [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.STEAL]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.STEAL}).
    * The player can [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.CATCH]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.CATCH}).
    * The player can [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.SLAMBACK]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.SLAMBACK}) , when given the opportunity.
    * The player can not [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.SLAM]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.SLAM}).
    * The player can not [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.STOMP]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.STOMP}).
    * The player may take neither #{Constants[Enums.Positions.STRIKER]}&ndash; nor #{Constants[Enums.Positions.GUARD]}&ndash;specific modifiers or bonuses.
    * The player moves like a #{Constants[Enums.Positions.JACK]} (i.e. may only move up to 1 hex as part of a #{Constants[Enums.Actions.THROW]} or #{Constants[Enums.Actions.STEAL]} action).
    * The player must attempt to #{Constants[Enums.Actions.CATCH]} a scattered ball. If the attempt fails then the rush will end.
    * In any other respect, the player still counds as a #{Constants[Enums.Positions.GUARD]}.
