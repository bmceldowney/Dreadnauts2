    #### Any player

    Only a player with the [#{Constants[Enums.Abilities.QUICKCHANGEARTIST]}](/abilities/#{Enums.Abilities.QUICKCHANGEARTIST}) ability may perform a #{Constants[Enums.Actions.TRANSFORM]} action.

    \#{Constants[Enums.Actions.TRANSFORM]} allows a player to change roles on the fly. The player spends 1 action per attempt, and may take no other action on that attempt.

    ##### #{Constants[Enums.Actions.TRANSFORM]} is a 3 dice 4+ test (1)

    tr
        td #{Constants[Enums.Actions.TRANSFORM]} fails
        td
            | The player remains in the role they are currently in, but may spend 
            | another action to try again.
    tr
        td #{Constants[Enums.Actions.TRANSFORM]} succeeds
        td
            | The player immediately changes role by one step: From #{Constants[Enums.Positions.JACK]} 
            | to #{Constants[Enums.Positions.GUARD]}/#{Constants[Enums.Positions.KEEPER]} 
            | or #{Constants[Enums.Positions.STRIKER]}, or back from #{Constants[Enums.Positions.GUARD]}
            | /#{Constants[Enums.Positions.KEEPER]} or #{Constants[Enums.Positions.STRIKER]} 
            | to #{Constants[Enums.Positions.JACK]}.
    tr
        td #{Constants[Enums.Actions.TRANSFORM]} doubles
        td
            | The player immediately changes to any role they choose.

    Note that a player must have the [#{Constants[Enums.Abilities.KEEPER]}](/abilities/#{Enums.Abilities.KEEPER}) ability to change to a #{Constants[Enums.Positions.KEEPER]} role.
