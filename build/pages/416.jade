    #### #{Constants[Enums.Positions.GUARD]} or #{Constants[Enums.Positions.JACK]} only

    \#{Constants[Enums.Actions.SUCKERPUNCH]} is a type of [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.SLAM]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.SLAM}) where the acting player begins in the front arc of their opponent, and then moves behind them to #{Constants[Enums.Actions.SLAM]} in **in a single action**.

    A #{Constants[Enums.Actions.SUCKERPUNCH]} is a Foul, and the opposing player may make a [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.REFCHECK]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.REFCHECK}) after the action has been resolved.

    Note that moving behind someone with one action, then attempting a #{Constants[Enums.Actions.SLAM]} from behind with a second action is not a Foul. Neither is attempting a #{Constants[Enums.Actions.SLAM]} from behind if the target when the acting player begins in their rear arc.
