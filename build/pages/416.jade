    | #{Constants[Enums.Actions.SUCKERPUNCH]} is a type of 
    a(href="/actions/#{Enums.Actions.SLAM}") #{Constants[Enums.Actions.SLAM]} 
    | where the acting player begins in the front arc of their opponent, and 
    | then moves behind them to #{Constants[Enums.Actions.SLAM]} in <strong>in a 
    | single action</strong>.
p
    | A #{Constants[Enums.Actions.SUCKERPUNCH]} is a Foul, and the opposing player 
    | may make a 
    a(href="/actions/#{Enums.Actions.REFCHECK}") #{Constants[Enums.Actions.REFCHECK]} 
    | after the action has been resolved.
p
    | Note that moving behind someone with one action, 
    | then attempting a #{Constants[Enums.Actions.SLAM]} from behind with a second 
    | action is not a Foul. Neither is attempting a #{Constants[Enums.Actions.SLAM]} 
    | from behind if the target when the acting player begins in their rear arc.
