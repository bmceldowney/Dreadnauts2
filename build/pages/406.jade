    #### Any player

    A player must #{Constants[Enums.Actions.EVADE]} whenever they attempt to move out of a hex that is threatened by an opposing player. Turning within a hex that is under threat does not require an #{Constants[Enums.Actions.EVADE]} attempt.

    ##### #{Constants[Enums.Actions.EVADE]} is a 3 dice Speed test (123)

    * +1 if the player is a #{Constants[Enums.Positions.STRIKER]}.
    * -1 per opposing player threatening the hex the player is moving **from** (maximum of -2).

    Note that a player who falls over as the result of an #{Constants[Enums.Actions.EVADE]} attempt will not take an #{Constants[Enums.Actions.ARMORCHECK]}, and will not be injured.
