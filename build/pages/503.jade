    #### #{Constants[Enums.Positions.GUARD]} or #{Constants[Enums.Positions.JACK]} only

    The player treats [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.STOMP]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.STOMP}) as if it were a [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.SLAM]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.SLAM}), being able to move 1 hex or [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.RUN]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.RUN}) (depending on the player's role). If the player did not start adjacent to the target, but moved adjacent during this action then they add 1 dice to their #{Constants[Enums.Actions.STOMP]}.

    Node that in the eyes of the Ref this is still a #{Constants[Enums.Actions.STOMP]} and so still a foul.
