h4 #{Constants[Enums.Positions.GUARD]} or #{Constants[Enums.Positions.JACK]} only
p
    | The player attempts to throw the ball to a teammate, at the strike hex to 
    | score, or at an opponent to injure them.
    | A #{Constants[Enums.Positions.STRIKER]} may take a full 
    a(href="/actions/#{Enums.Actions.RUN}") #{Constants[Enums.Actions.RUN]} 
    | action as part of a #{Constants[Enums.Actions.THROW]} attempt, and may 
    a(href="/actions/#{Enums.Actions.DASH}") #{Constants[Enums.Actions.DASH]} 
    | if they choose to do so.
    | A #{Constants[Enums.Positions.JACK]} 
    | may move up to 1 hex before making a #{Constants[Enums.Actions.THROW]}, turning 
    | for free if they wish, but may not #{Constants[Enums.Actions.DASH]} 
    | unless they have the 
    a(href="/actions/#{Enums.Abilities.SLIDE}") #{Constants[Enums.Abilities.SLIDE]} 
    | ability.

h5 #{Constants[Enums.Actions.THROW]} is an (n) dice Skill test (1)
ul
    li +1 if the player is a #{Constants[Enums.Positions.STRIKER]}.
    li -1 if the target is a Strike Hex.
    li -1 if the player moved at all during this action.
    li -1 per opposing player threatening the hex the player is in (maximum of -2).

h5 Calculating distance
p
    | The number of dice rolled (n) during the test is based on the distance between 
    | the player making the #{Constants[Enums.Actions.THROW]} attempt and their target. 
    | The target must be visible (i.e. in the player's front arc, and with a clear route between them).
p
    | Distance is measured 
    | by the shortest route, though there may be more than one shortest route. If 
    | all possible shortest routes between the player and their target must cross 
    | a standing player, then a #{Constants[Enums.Actions.THROW]} attempt can not 
    | be made. Otherwise, if the route contains only empty hexes or fallen players, 
    | then use the following table to determine how many dice to use:
table.table.table-striped
    tr
        td 1&ndash;3 hexes
        td 3 dice
    tr
        td 4&ndash;6 hexes
        td 2 dice
    tr
        td 7&ndash;9 hexes
        td 1 dice

h5 Throwing a Strike
p A Strike may only be thrown from an opponent's Strike Zone.
table.table.table-striped
    tr
        td #{Constants[Enums.Actions.THROW]} fails
        td The ball scatters and the rush ends.
    tr
        td #{Constants[Enums.Actions.THROW]} succeeds
        td 
            | Strike! Points are awarded to the player's team, the rush ends and 
            | the ball is relaunched.
    tr
        td #{Constants[Enums.Actions.THROW]} doubles
        td Strike! The player's team also gets a Fan Check.

h5 Passing to a teammate
p 
    | When passing to a teammate, the player making the #{Constants[Enums.Actions.THROW]} 
    | attempt must be in the target's front arc.
table.table.table-striped
    tr
        td #{Constants[Enums.Actions.THROW]} fails
        td 
            | Inaccurate pass! The teammate may still make an attempt to 
            a(href="/actions/#{Enums.Actions.CATCH}") #{Constants[Enums.Actions.CATCH]} 
            | the ball, but with no dice except those granted by modifiers or coaching 
            | dice. If the #{Constants[Enums.Actions.CATCH]} fails, then the ball 
            | scatters and the rush is over.
    tr
        td #{Constants[Enums.Actions.THROW]} succeeds
        td 
            | The target player has as many dice as there were successes with which 
            | to make a #{Constants[Enums.Actions.CATCH]} attempt.

h5 Throwing the ball at an opposing player
p 
    | Throwing the ball at an opposing player is not a Foul, but still counts as 
    | losing the ball, and will end the rush. If the player making the #{Constants[Enums.Actions.THROW]} 
    | attempt is in the target's front arc, then the target may attempt to 
    a(href="/actions/#{Enums.Actions.DODGE}") #{Constants[Enums.Actions.DODGE]}
    | . If the target cannot #{Constants[Enums.Actions.DODGE]}, then it is played 
    | as though the target had 0 successes.

            | winner. The winning player chooses which one. The losing player is 
            | turned to face directly at the hex they just left. The ball scatters 
            | and the rush ends.

            | equal to the difference between the two rolls. The ball scatters and
