    #### Any player

    When any opposing player moves into an adjacent hex, a player with the #{Constants[Enums.Abilities.ALERT]} ability may immediately choose to turn and face their opponent. This happns before any [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.SLAM]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.SLAM}) or [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.STEAL]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.STEAL}) action is resolved, or before the opposing player moves any further.

    Note that this action does not stop the opposing player's action.
