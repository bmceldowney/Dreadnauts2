    #### Any #{Constants[Enums.Races.JUDWAN]} player

    The player can [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.THROW]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.THROW}) a maximum range of 12 hexes instead of just 9. This replaces the normal distance table used to calculate the number of dice used during a #{Constants[Enums.Actions.THROW]} action with the following:

table.table.table-striped
    tr
        td 1&ndash;4 hexes
        td 3 dice
    tr
        td 5&ndash;8 hexes
        td 2 dice
    tr
        td 9&ndash;12 hexes
        td 1 dice

    **Important note:** A player with the #{Constants[Enums.Abilities.LONGARMS]} ability may not score bonus points. This means that a successful Strike attempt is worth 1 or 3 points, regardless of which Strike Hex the attempt was made from.
