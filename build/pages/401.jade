    #### Any player

    A player may move through a number of unoccupied hexes equal to or below **twice** the value of their Move stat. The player may make a [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.DASH]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.DASH}) attempt if they wish to move further.

    During a #{Constants[Enums.Actions.SPRINT]} action, the player may only move into the hex directly in front of them. Each 60Â° turn (one side of a hex) the player makes counts as one hex towards their movement.
