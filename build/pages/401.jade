h4 Any player
p
    | A player may move through a number of unoccupied hexes equal to or 
    | below 
    strong twice 
    | the value of their Move stat. The player may make a 
    a(href="/actions/#{Enums.Actions.DASH}") #{Constants[Enums.Actions.DASH]} 
    | attempt if they wish to move further.
p
    | During a #{Constants[Enums.Actions.SPRINT]} action, the player may only move 
    | into the hex directly in front of them. Each 60&deg; turn (one side 
    | of a hex) the player makes counts as one hex towards their movement.
