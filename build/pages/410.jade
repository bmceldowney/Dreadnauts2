    #### #{Constants[Enums.Positions.GUARD]} or #{Constants[Enums.Positions.JACK]} only

    A player may #{Constants[Enums.Actions.SLAMBACK]} in response to a [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.SLAM]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.SLAM}) or [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.STEAL]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.STEAL}) attempt if the opposing player is in their front arc.

    ##### #{Constants[Enums.Actions.SLAMBACK]} is a 3 dice Strength test (1)

    * +1 if the player is a #{Constants[Enums.Positions.GUARD]}.
    * -1 per opposing player threatening the hex the player is in (ignoring the target, maximum of -2).
