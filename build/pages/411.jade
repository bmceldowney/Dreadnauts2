    #### #{Constants[Enums.Positions.GUARD]} or #{Constants[Enums.Positions.JACK]} only

    A #{Constants[Enums.Actions.STOMP]} is a type of [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.SLAM]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.SLAM}) that ocurrs when the target player is on the ground. The player making the #{Constants[Enums.Actions.STOMP]} attempt may not move as part of this action unless they have the [#{Constants[Enums.Abilities.DOESTHISHURT]}](/abilities/#{Enums.Abilities.DOESTHISHURT}) ability. The only response the target of a #{Constants[Enums.Actions.STOMP]} attempt can make is [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.DODGE]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.DODGE}), which they do at -1 die (for being on the floor). A target with the [#{Constants[Enums.Abilities.ROLL]}](/abilities/#{Enums.Abilities.ROLL}) ability may #{Constants[Enums.Actions.DODGE]} without penalty.

    ##### #{Constants[Enums.Actions.STOMP]} is a 3 dice Strength test (1)

    * +1 if the player is a #{Constants[Enums.Positions.GUARD]}.
    * -1 per opposing player threatening the hex the player is in (maximum of -2).
