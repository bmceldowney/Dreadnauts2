    #### #{Constants[Enums.Positions.STRIKER]}, #{Constants[Enums.Positions.JACK]} or #{Constants[Enums.Positions.KEEPER]} only

    An attempt to #{Constants[Enums.Actions.PICKUP]} must be made as a part of any action that moves a #{Constants[Enums.Positions.JACK]}, #{Constants[Enums.Positions.STRIKER]} or #{Constants[Enums.Positions.KEEPER]} onto a hex that contains the ball.

    As part of a [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.SPRINT]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.SPRINT}) action, the player must try to #{Constants[Enums.Actions.PICKUP]} before they change facing. As part of a [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.RUN]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.RUN}) action, the player may face any direction before attempting to #{Constants[Enums.Actions.PICKUP]}.

    ##### #{Constants[Enums.Actions.PICKUP]} is a 3 dice Skill test (1)
    
    * +1 if the player is a #{Constants[Enums.Positions.STRIKER]}.
    * -1 if the player is a #{Constants[Enums.Positions.KEEPER]}.
    * -1 if this is part of a #{Constants[Enums.Actions.SPRINT]} action.
    * -1 per opposing player threatening the hex the player is in (maximum of -2).

    Note that if a #{Constants[Enums.Positions.GUARD]} moves into a hex containing the ball, then the ball scatters immediately without ending the rush.

    A player keeps the ball until they choose to [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.THROW]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.THROW}) it, or until they ar knocked or fall down. If a player is knocked or falls down then the ball scatters in the direction they were facing from the hex they land in.

    Holding the ball has no effect on a player's stats or available actions other than allowing them to make a #{Constants[Enums.Actions.THROW]} attempt.
