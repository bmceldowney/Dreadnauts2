    #### #{Constants[Enums.Positions.GUARD]} or #{Constants[Enums.Positions.JACK]} only

    A player with this ability may not be knocked down as the result of a [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.SLAM]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.SLAM}). The player may still be pushed back or injured, and must still make an [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.ARMORCHECK]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.ARMORCHECK}) if the #{Constants[Enums.Actions.SLAM]} attempt is doubled.

    Note that a player with #{Constants[Enums.Actions.SLAM]} can still fall down on their own, e.g. if they fail an attempt to [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.DASH]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.DASH}) or [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.EVADE]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.EVADE})
