    #### #{Constants[Enums.Positions.STRIKER]} or #{Constants[Enums.Positions.JACK]} only

    If the player is the target of a [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.STOMP]}](/abilities/#{Enums.Actions.STOMP}), treat a normal win for [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.DODGE]}](/abilities/#{Enums.Actions.DODGE}) as though it were a double win.
