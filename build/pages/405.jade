    #### #{Constants[Enums.Positions.STRIKER]}, #{Constants[Enums.Positions.JACK]} or #{Constants[Enums.Positions.KEEPER]} only

    A #{Constants[Enums.Actions.CATCH]} attempt is not a deliberate action, but a response to either a teammate's [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.THROW]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.THROW}) action or a scattered or launched ball. A player can make a #{Constants[Enums.Actions.CATCH]} attempt only if the ball is coming towards them in their front arc. If a player *can* #{Constants[Enums.Actions.CATCH]} then they *must* attempt a #{Constants[Enums.Actions.CATCH]}.

    ##### #{Constants[Enums.Actions.CATCH]} is an (n) dice Skill test (1)

    * +1 if the player is a #{Constants[Enums.Positions.STRIKER]}.
    * -1 if the player is a #{Constants[Enums.Positions.KEEPER]}.
    * -1 per opposing player threatening the hex the player is in (maximum of -2).

    ##### Calculating accuracy

    The number of dice rolled (n) during the test is based on the accuracy of of the #{Constants[Enums.Actions.THROW]}. The player attempting a #{Constants[Enums.Actions.CATCH]} may roll a number of dice equal to the number of successes from the previous #{Constants[Enums.Actions.THROW]} attempt. If the player is attempting to #{Constants[Enums.Actions.CATCH]} a ball that has been scattered or launched, then it counts as an inaccurate pass and the player has 0 dice to roll. The player may still gain dice through modifiers or coaching dice.
