    #### Any player

    Whenever a player with #{Constants[Enums.Abilities.MINDLIKEWATER]} is the target of a [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.SLAM]}](/abilities/#{Enums.Actions.SLAM}) attempt, they will always [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.SLAMBACK]}](/abilities/#{Enums.Actions.SLAMBACK}), even if the #{Constants[Enums.Actions.SLAM]} came from behind.

    * The player uses their Speed stat to calculate the number of successes.
    * The player gets the same number of dice as the attacking player.
    * No other modifiers are applied to the player's #{Constants[Enums.Actions.SLAMBACK]}.

    A player with this ability who makes a #{Constants[Enums.Actions.SLAM]} attempt does so normally.
