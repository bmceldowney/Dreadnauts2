h4 Any player
p
	| You may only have this ability if you already have the 
	a(href="/abilities/#{Enums.Abilities.LUCKY}") #{Constants[Enums.Abilities.LUCKY]} 
	| ability (which this replaces). A player cannot have both at the same time.
p
	| This works just like #{Constants[Enums.Abilities.LUCKY]}, but a player can 
	| use it once per action instead of just once per rush.

	a(href="/abilities/#{Enums.Abilities.LUCKY}") #{Constants[Enums.Abilities.LUCKY]} page.
