    #### Any player

    You may only have the #{Constants[Enums.Abilities.REALLYLUCKY]} ability if you already have the [#{Constants[Enums.Abilities.LUCKY]}](/abilities/#{Enums.Abilities.LUCKY}) ability (which this replaces). A player cannot have both at the same time.

    This works just like #{Constants[Enums.Abilities.LUCKY]}, but a player can use it once per action instead of just once per rush.

    For more information visit the [#{Constants[Enums.Abilities.LUCKY]}](/abilities/#{Enums.Abilities.LUCKY}) page.
