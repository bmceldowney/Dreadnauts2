    #### Any player

    A player with this ability who tries to [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.STANDUP]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.STANDUP}) will automatically do so as if they doubled the test. Note that no test is actually rolled. in effect, knocking down a player with this skill merely stops them using [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.SPRINT]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.SPRINT}) as their next action.
