h4 Any player
p
	| A player with this ability who tries to 
	a(href="/actions/#{Enums.Actions.STANDUP}") #{Constants[Enums.Actions.STANDUP]} 
	| will automatically do so as if they doubled the test. Note that no test is actually 
	| rolled. in effect, knocking down a player with this skill merely stops them using 
	a(href="/actions/#{Enums.Actions.SPRINT}") #{Constants[Enums.Actions.SPRINT]} 
	| as their next action.
