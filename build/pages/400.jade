h4 Any player
p
    | A player may move through a number of unoccupied hexes equal to or 
    | below the value of their Move stat. The player may make a 
    a(href="/actions/#{Enums.Actions.DASH}") #{Constants[Enums.Actions.DASH]} 
    | attempt if they wish to move further.
p
    | While taking a #{Constants[Enums.Actions.RUN]} action, the player may move 
    | freely, and turning does not count towards the distance moved.
