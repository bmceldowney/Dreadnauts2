    #### Any player

    A player may move through a number of unoccupied hexes equal to or below the value of their Move stat. The player may make a [#{Constants[Enums .Actions.DASH]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.DASH}) attempt if they wish to move further.

    While taking a #{Constants[Enums.Actions.RUN]} action, the player may move freely, and turning does not count towards the distance moved.
