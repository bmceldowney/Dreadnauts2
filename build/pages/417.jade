    #### #{Constants[Enums.Positions.STRIKER]} or #{Constants[Enums.Positions.JACK]} only

    Only a player with the [#{Constants[Enums.Abilities.JUMP]}](/abilities/#{Enums.Abilities.JUMP}) ability may perform a #{Constants[Enums.Actions.JUMP]} action.

    \#{Constants[Enums.Actions.JUMP]} is part of a [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.RUN]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.RUN}) or [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.SPRINT]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.SPRINT}) action that allows the player to leap over teammates or opponents. It is a 2 hex move (and costs 2 hexes of movement).

    ##### #{Constants[Enums.Actions.JUMP]} is a 3 dice Speed test (123)

    * +1 if the player is a #{Constants[Enums.Positions.STRIKER]}.
    * -1 per opposing player threatening the hex the player is moving **from** (maximum of -2).

    Note that a player falling over as part of a failed #{Constants[Enums.Actions.JUMP]} does not have to make an #{Constants[Enums.Actions.ARMORCHECK]} and will not be injured. However, if they are carrying the ball then the ball will scatter and end the rush.

    Also note that a player may need to [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.DASH]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.DASH}) in order to gain the extra movement to #{Constants[Enums.Actions.JUMP]} into a new hex. Roll each test separately. If the player fails any #{Constants[Enums.Actions.DASH]} attempts that are required for the #{Constants[Enums.Actions.JUMP]} then they will fall over into the hex they were attempting to #{Constants[Enums.Actions.JUMP]} into.

    A player making a #{Constants[Enums.Actions.JUMP]} does not need to roll an [#{Constants[Enums.Actions.EVADE]}](/actions/#{Enums.Actions.EVADE}) for that part of their movement, though they are subject to the normal rules both before and after the #{Constants[Enums.Actions.JUMP]} attempt.
